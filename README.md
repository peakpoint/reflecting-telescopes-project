Two images are under `CC-BY-SA GFDL`, `CC BY-SA 2.0` respectively. One is in the public domain. They are found in `public/images`.

This project was made using the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework, [routify](https://github.com/sveltech/routify), and the [less](http://lesscss.org/) style sheet language. It also uses the [p5.js](p5js.org), [p5.collide2D](https://github.com/bmoren/p5.collide2D), and [aos](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) libraries. 


Yes, the *almost* empty `src/pages/images` folder is necessary (don't ask).
